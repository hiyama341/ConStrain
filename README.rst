ConStrain is now called teemi
-----------------------------


Hey there!

We just wanted to give you a heads up that we've recently changed the name of ConStrain to teemi, named after the Greek god of fairness. 
This change is just the next step in the evolution of our platform, and teemi is a continuation of the work we've been doing with ConStrain.
You can find the new repository `here <https://github.com/hiyama341/ConStrain/tree/main/colab_notebooks>`__. 

All the code from the old repository will be available in the new one, and we'll be regularly updating it with new features and improvements. 
So, you can expect to see even more exciting developments in the future.

But, just a heads up - any issues, pull requests, or other contributions you made to the old repository won't be transferred over. So, if you want to contribute, you'll need to resubmit any contributions to the new repository.

If you have any questions or concerns about the migration, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us at luclev@dtu.dk.

We really appreciate your support and can't wait to continue working with you in our new and improved teemi repository.

Cheers,

Lucas Levassor
