Welcome to ConStrain's documentation!
======================================

Our mission is to revolutionize the way in which we make biology.
How do we do that? We pursue reproducible high-throughput strain construction by adopting literate programming with ConStrain.
We hope you want to be part of the revolution.
Below you will find documentation for how to install and use ConStrain.


Suppose you are interested in examples, head over to our colab_notebooks. 
Feel free to reach out if something is unclear.
