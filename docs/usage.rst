Usage
=====

To use teemi in a project::

    import teemi


If you want to access some of the functions or classes in the submodules you can do the following::

    from teemi.design.cloning import USER_enzyme


We believe the best way to use teemi is through Jupyter notebooks/lab either locally or through Google colab. 

The notebooks can be found `here <https://github.com/hiyama341/teemi/tree/main/colab_notebooks>`__ or under the tab "Colab notebooks".
